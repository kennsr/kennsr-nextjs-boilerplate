# Kennard Sugirotok (kennsr) - Next.js Enterprise Boilerplate

This repository demonstrates high-level engineering standards for building scalable, performance-optimized React applications using Next.js 15.

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

- **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict Mode)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui primitives
- **State Management:** 
  - **Server Cache:** TanStack Query (v5)
  - **Client State:** Zustand (Performance-optimized stores)
- **Demo Feature:** High-Performance POS (Point of Sale) system showcasing rapid state updates and UI fluidity.

## 🚀 Performance Patterns Demonstrated

1. **Server-Side API Optimization:** Usage of `cache()` for request deduplication in Server Components.
2. **Client-Side Efficiency:** TanStack Query integration for automatic caching and revalidation.
3. **Optimistic UI:** Implementation of optimistic updates for real-time responsiveness.
4. **Subtle Motion:** Integrated Framer Motion for high-rigor, "Linear-style" design.
